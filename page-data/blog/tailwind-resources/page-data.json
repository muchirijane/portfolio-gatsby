{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-js","path":"/blog/tailwind-resources","result":{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Tailwind CSS Resources you wish you had."},"html":"<h4>Background story</h4>\n<p>This week I decided to take a look at Tailwind CSS and create a simple e-commerce website. The first thing I noticed is how well the documentation was written. Even if Tailwind is your first CSS framework, you will easily be able to navigate through different sectionsðŸ˜‰. Some areas like Navigation, they have uploaded a few video tutorials to help you create a nav with ease. All sections have code snippets with interactive widgets that show you how the UI component will look like in different screen sizes. Also, there is a customizing section that shows you how to apply custom styles, eg how to add specific <code>rems</code>, <code>colors</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>insets</code>, etc. The documentation made it easy for me to be able to code it faster. The best thing is, the framework doesn't limit you. People can't tell if you built your website from scratch or using the tailwind framework. Every site will still have their unique attributes depending on the designs and utility classes implemented.\nTop to it off, Tailwind uses a mobile-first breakpoint system and only uses <code>min-width</code> instead of <code>max-width</code>. The classes you add for smaller breakpoints will be used in larger breakpoints. This took a minute to get used to it because I have always used <code>max-width</code> but I really love it now.\nThe most useful method that made my Html file clean and organized is using the <code>@apply</code> method. Instead of making the utility classes be all over the HTML file, I used them on the style.css file. It's like using mixin in SASS.</p>\n<p><b>PS:</b> Before you start with Tailwind CSS please make sure you understand Html and CSS first. This way, you won't get confused with utility classes and how to apply them. If you are more of a visual person and don't like learning through documentation as much, I would recommend the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmDnn7lrnk&#x26;list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw\">Net Ninja Tailwind CSS crash course</a>. Shaun will take you through how to build a simple website from scratch with Tailwind.
